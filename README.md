# MASKY

> OpenAPI Flask app that serves data to masky model for predictions.

## Features

Its not just Flask but an ecosystem to properly create a RESTful API service:

- [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/index.html) is a simple, flexible, and reliable distributed system to process vast amounts of messages, while providing operations with the tools required to maintain such a system. Itâ€™s a task queue with focus on real-time processing, while also supporting task scheduling.
- [Connexion](https://connexion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a framework on top of Flask that automagically handles HTTP requests defined using OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger), supporting both v2.0 and v3.0 of the specification.
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) is a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. It is designed to make getting started very quickly and very easily.
- [marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is an ORM/ODM/framework-agnostic library for converting complex datatypes, such as objects, to and from native Python datatypes.
- [Flask-Marshmallow](https://flask-marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a thin integration layer for Flask and marshmallow that adds additional features to marshmallow.
- [PyMongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is a Python distribution containing tools for working with MongoDB, and is the recommended way to work with MongoDB from Python.
- [Flask-PyMongo](https://flask-pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Flask-Script](https://flask-script.readthedocs.io/)
